# Facial Landmark Recognition


This repository implements a facial keypoint detection system using Convolutional Neural Network CNNs. It enables the identification of 15 key points on a face, viz. the corners & center point of eyes, eyebrows, nose tip, and mouth, which can be valuable for various computer vision applications. 



The model is trained on the dataset, which consists of 7049 training images labeled with lot of facial key points.
