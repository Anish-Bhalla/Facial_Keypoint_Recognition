This repository implements a facial keypoint detection system using Convolutional Neural Network CNNs. It enables the identification of 15 key points on a face, viz. the corners & center point of eyes, eyebrows, nose tip, and mouth,which can be valuable for various computer vision applications. 

This project is an implementation of Kaggle Competition **Facial Keypoints Detection** available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection/data

The model is trained on the dataset, which consists of 7049 training images labeled with some missing facial key points.
